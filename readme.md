# Maxmind Databases 

This repository contains weekly updated MaxMind Databases. 

 - GeoLite2-Country
 - GeoLite2-ASN  

more databases and different formats could be added in time. 

MaxMind is requiring **LICENCE KEY** even though  you would like to download FREE databases.

More detail regarding to that requirement can be found here: 
 
 - [GeoLite2_CCPA_GDPR](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/)

To remove that requirement I have created this mini repository to download and release weekly updated databases from MaxMind. 
 
The workflow file can be run manually and it will run every week at 00.00 on Monday. 

All downloaded files can be directly accessed from [RELEASES](https://github.com/mrtrkmnhub/maxmind-databases/releases)
